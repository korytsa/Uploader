# Multithreaded uploader
This project have developed to show you how to create multithreaded file uploading in javascript.

More information about multithreaded uploading you can find in my article [here](https://medium.com/@pilovm/multithreaded-file-uploading-with-javascript-dafabce34ccd).
## How to test it
You have to clone the repository and start the server
```
git clone https://github.com/pilovm/multithreaded-uploader.git
```
```
npm i
```
```
npm start
```
Then you can open `localhost:3000` and try to upload files. They will store in `files` folder.
